            <h6>Carbon pricing is a fair, feasible, and powerful solution to climate change. When it costs money to pollute the air, we’ll get fewer emissions and more renewable energy.</h6>
            <h6>When we impose a fee on fossil fuel extraction, that fee will take in revenue. We can then distribute all of that revenue to US households in a monthly check. That means individuals who consume less than the average amount of carbon- generally those with a lower income- will come out ahead.</h6>
            <h6>Carbon pricing is also the most economically efficient and painless way to tackle the climate crisis. In fact, carbon pricing is the first-choice strategy for reducing emissions for 81% of economists who have published work on climate change. Even better, carbon pricing is already working in many countries around the world. You can learn more about one popular national carbon price proposal here.</h6>
            <h6>We’re excited to make Pennsylvania a leader in moving forward on this powerful solution.</h6>
