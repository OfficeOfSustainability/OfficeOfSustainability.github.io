            <h6>As young people, climate change threatens our future and people’s lives across the globe. We’re dedicated to a just transition away from a fossil fuel dependent economy. Carbon pricing is a fair, feasible, and powerful solution to the climate crisis, and we’re excited to bring that message to Harrisburg. </h6>
            <h6>Safe Climate PA</h6>
            <h6>Safe Climate PA is an opportunity to learn about carbon pricing and how to engage with elected officials and the media, and then to put those lessons into practice.</h6>
            <h6>Our Goal</h6>
            <h6>The event will feature an exploration of climate change, carbon pricing policies, and the role that Pennsylvania can play in ensuring a safer climate. The afternoon will feature workshops that will explore carbon pricing as well as the impact that carbon pricing would have on other climate fights in PA. We will also provide training to prepare and empower you to meet with elected officials in the state government. You will have a chance to work closely with other members in your district to create a plan of action for engaging with your representative. Check out the full schedule below!</h6>
            <h6>Talk with Your Elected Officials!</h6>
            <h6>When you register for the event, we will support you to set up meetings with your elected officials on or after April 7th and get connected with others in your district. You can find your district and representatives at <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/" id = "head3" >this link</a>.</h6>
            <h6>Get Involved!</h6>
            <h6>In Harrisburg, we will come to together as a state to build momentum for this solution. We will let our elected officials know that carbon pricing is an important and practical step to a safer climate. Come join us for the Safe Climate PA event and make your voice heard!</h6>

            <h6>Carbon pricing is a fair, feasible, and powerful solution to climate change. When it costs money to pollute the air, we’ll get fewer emissions and more renewable energy.</h6>
            <h6>When we impose a fee on fossil fuel extraction, that fee will take in revenue. We can then distribute all of that revenue to US households in a monthly check. That means individuals who consume less than the average amount of carbon- generally those with a lower income- will come out ahead.</h6>
            <h6>Carbon pricing is also the most economically efficient and painless way to tackle the climate crisis. In fact, carbon pricing is the first-choice strategy for reducing emissions for <a href="http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf" id = "head3" >81% of economists</a> who have published work on climate change. Even better, carbon pricing is already working in many countries <a href="http://citizensclimatelobby.org/laser-talks/carbon-prices-around-world/" id = "head3" >around the world</a>. You can learn more about one popular national carbon price proposal <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/" id = "head3" >here</a>.</h6>
